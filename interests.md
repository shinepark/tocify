## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
research focuses on making agricultural drones used for multi-swarm operations on a field.

Some of my paper titles include:
* Spray performance evaluation of a six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle sprayer for pesticide application using an orchard operation mode in apple orchards.
* "Material optimization for UAV frames: A comparative study of composite structures.
* Artificial intelligence in UAV path optimization for smart agriculture
* Multi-rotor UAVs in precision agriculture: A review of flight stability and environmental tolerance
* Mathematical modeling and validation of the Aerial Robot Control System with the Pixhawk Flight Controller
* Dynamic Flight Tracking: Designing System for multirotor uavs with Pixhawk Autopilot Data Verification
