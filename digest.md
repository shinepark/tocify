arXiv:2602.07101v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: UAV navigation in unstructured outdoor environments using passive monocular vision is hindered by the substantial visual domain gap between simulation and reality. While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinfor…

arXiv:2602.07074v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper develops a real-time, search-based aircraft contingency landing planner that minimizes traffic disruptions while accounting for ground risk. The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-…

arXiv:2602.07054v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Emotion understanding is essential for building socially intelligent agents. Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to e…
