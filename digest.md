<p>The brain can be conceptualized as a control system facilitating transitions between states, such as from rest to motor activity. Applying network control theory to measurements of brain signals enables characterization of brain dynamics through control properties. However, most prior studies that have applied network control theory have evaluated brain dynamics under unperturbed conditions, neglecting the critical role of external perturbations in accurate system identification. In this stud…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Battista et al. use biologically plausible RNNs to uncover the circuit mechanisms of economic choice. They propose a two-stage framework where feedforward inputs compute offer values and recurrent inhibition drives comparison. This architecture explains how the brain generalizes preferences and multitasks using compositional neural codes, offering a unified theory of decision-making.

<p>Neuronal ensembles, which represent coordinated activity patterns within individual brain regions, play crucial roles in memory. While local ensembles dynamically change in response to experience, factors influencing the stability of neuronal ensemble compositions remain largely unknown. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of neuronal ensembles in the prelimbic cortex layer 5 (PL5), basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus CA1 region (vCA1) during conditioning, e…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>Allodynia (perceiving touch as painful) is an enduring symptom of neuropathic pain. While acute pain is initiated by afferent signaling from the periphery to spinal cord, pain chronification recruits ongoing activity in supraspinal sites. One such site that has been proposed to be important in pain chronification is the caudal granular insular cortex (CGIC). The present studies of allodynia in response to sciatic nerve injury in male and female rats focus on the role of CGIC in pain chronific…

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

<p>The brain computes the spatiotopic position of touch by integrating tactile and proprioceptive signals (i.e., tactile remapping). While it is often assumed that the spatiotopic touch location is mapped into extrinsic, limb-independent coordinates, an alternative view proposes that touch is remapped into intrinsic, limb-specific coordinates. To test between these hypotheses, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a novel tactile stimulation paradigm in which participants (<i>N</i> = 20, 19 f…
